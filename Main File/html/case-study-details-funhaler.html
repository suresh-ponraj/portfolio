						<p>Control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. </p>

						<h4 class="header-border">Findings</h4>
						<p>We started with secondary research into the current ecosystem of children with asthma. Then, in our interviews, we focused on specific challenges and experiences that stakeholders had.</p>
						<p>Medication shouldn't be trial and error. Children with asthma have different treatment plans. One interviewee mentioned how his childhood asthma wasn't severe enough for him to carry an inhaler, so he used a nebulizer instead when necessary. Another mentioned repeat visits to the doctor after each attack to get new medication to try. To add to the frustration, it's difficult to pinpoint asthma attack triggers and new ones can pop up at any time.</p>
						<p>There are several educational resources out there for parents and their children on how to deal with asthma. A lot of focus is on medical treatment, which is understandable. But where's the focus on the social and emotional aspect for the children? Asthma treatment should be multi-dimensional.</p>

					<div class="cs-solve-content">
						<p>Affected children are isolated because they can't participate. A school teacher told us that kids with asthma don’t want special treatment or to be singled out. They want to be treated like all the other children.</p>
						<p>Asthma is a mystery to other kids, and that scares them. In our interview with a kindergarten teacher, she told us that children would shun kids if they looked or acted different. Children get scared when they see other kids get asthma attacks or use an inhaler. From the teacher’s experience, talking about the illness openly is a good way to demystify asthma.</p>
						<p>Valuable knowledge for proper care becomes redundant. Teachers can get to know a child and their asthma triggers very well, but all that knowledge is lost at the end of the school year. This makes it hard for children because their new teachers have to learn everything about them, a cycle that repeats each school year.</p>

						<p>It's hard on the kids and potentially harder on the parents. Parents worry about their child having an asthma attack and not receiving proper treatment. Finding a supporting community can be difficult for parents, who often need emotional and logistical support. One participant mentioned missing work multiple times whenever her child had an asthma attack or medical appointment.</p>

							<p>From our affinity diagram and journey map, we identified four areas in which we could focus our solution.</p>
							<p><i><u>Medical:</u></i> Data tracking to improve diagnoses and prescriptions</p>
							<p><i><u>Emotional Support:</u></i> Provide comfort and consultation for parents</p>
							<p><i><u>Social Support:</u></i> Transform perception of asthma to deal with child exclusion</p>
							<p><i><u>Communication:</u></i> Effective communication channels between kid, parent, school, and doctor</p>

						<h4 class="header-border">Ideation</h4>
						<p>We came up with two concepts and pitched both to Philips to get their feedback. Both our concepts focused on normalizing asthma, but one solution focused on the child, while the other focused on influencing people in the child's environment.</p>

						<h4 class="header-border">Consideration</h4>
						<p>Doctors aren't the best marketers. How would we spread the word about FunHaler? We initially thought of giving doctors pamphlets to hand out during their appointments, but this was very dependent on the doctors' receptiveness.</p>
						<p>Can we even sell inhalers online? Online pharmacies aren't commonplace in the USA. The most comparable model we found was Warby Parker. Could we deal with our customer's insurance instead so that they don't have to pay upfront? Partnering with companies such as CVS or Walgreens is probably the best bet here.</p>
						<p>Inhalers are certain colors for a reason. We also looked into the color coding of Asthma inhalers and found that they are there to distinguish between “relievers”, and “preventers." Our design would need to consider this, perhaps by using a color band that is not blocked off by the custom design.</p>

						<h4 class="header-border">Service Proposal</h4>
						<p>We validated the two ideas with our interviewees and our client, all of whom liked the FunHaler idea better. It's a solution that focuses specifically on the person suffering, instead of trying to fix everything around them.</p>
						<p>Our service empowers children with asthma by providing them with a custom-designed inhaler that they can be proud of. It differs from other asthma services because it focuses on improving emotional health.</p>

							<h4 class="header-border">Reflection</h4>
							<p>Funhaler is an easy way for parents and kids to get medication they need right at home. Kids can avoid the scary and uncomfortable experience of going into, and waiting at, a pharmacy. It's a way to empower kids so that they can celebrate their difference instead of being ashamed of it.</p>
							<p>Our next steps would be validating this concept with children and their parents. Another murky area is health insurance, which needs to be figured out to ensure that this service is viable.</p>
